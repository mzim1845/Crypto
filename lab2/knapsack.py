    1. Build a superincreasing sequence `w` of length n
        Note: You can double-check that a sequence is superincreasing by using:
            `utils.is_superincreasing(seq)`
    2. Choose some integer `q` greater than the sum of all elements in `w`
    3. Discover an integer `r` between 2 and q that is coprime to `q`
        Note: You can use `utils.coprime(r, q)` for this.
    You'll also need to use the random module's `randint` function, which you
    will have to import.
    Somehow, you'll have to return all three of these values from this function!
    Can we do that in Python?!

        byte. In principle, we should work for any value of n, but we'll

    2. For each byte, determine its 8 bits (the `a_i`s). You can use
        `utils.byte_to_bits(byte)`.
    3. Encrypt the 8 message bits by computing
         c = sum of a_i * b_i for i = 1 to n
