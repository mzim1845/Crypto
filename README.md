## Cryptography assignments

The repository contains two assignments (lab1, lab2) for my Cryptography course, BSc.

### lab1
lab1 contains introductory exercises to Python. \
It was forked from stanfordpython/python-assignments:main, and it already had a README included describing the exercises.

### lab2
