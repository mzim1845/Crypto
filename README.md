## Cryptography assignments

The repository contains two assignments (lab1, lab2) for my Cryptography course, BSc.

### lab1
*lab1* contains introductory exercises to Python. \
It was forked from stanfordpython/python-assignments:main, and it already had a README included describing the exercises.

### lab2
*lab2* contains the implementation of a Client-Client console communication through a Server. I use Knapsack encryption algorithm for creating the key pairs, and Solitaire stream cipher to encrypt the messages. \
*tests* contains unit tests to evaluate the correctness of the network and the cipher.
